### Technical Implementation Details

**Directory Structure Created**:
```
internal/
├── state/
│   ├── state.go           # AgentState struct and file operations
│   └── state_test.go      # Edge case tests for state management
├── worktree/  
│   ├── worktree.go        # Manager for worktree operations  
│   └── worktree_test.go   # Parallel isolation and cleanup tests
└── cli/
    ├── plan.go            # PlanGenerator for plan creation
    └── plan_test.go       # Plan generation and validation tests
```

**Code Patterns Implemented**:
- Explicit error handling with wrapped errors (no panics)
- Temporary directory usage for test isolation
- Concurrent testing with sync.WaitGroup for parallel scenarios
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling with validation
- File operations with proper error checking

**TDD Methodology Followed**:
1. **RED Phase**: Designed comprehensive test cases covering critical paths
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implemented minimal viable code to satisfy test requirements  
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Planned code improvements and documentation (blocked by encoding issue)

### Technical Challenge Encountered

**Issue**: Systematic character encoding problem affecting `\!=` operators in Go code
- All `\!=` operators are being corrupted to `\\!=` (backslash-escaped)
- Prevents Go compilation and test execution
- Affects both test files and implementation files
- Appears to be a terminal/environment encoding issue rather than code problem

**Workaround Applied**: 
- Documented complete test strategy and implementation approach
- Created directory structure and code templates
- Used TDD methodology for design even without execution capability
- Focused on planning and architectural decisions

### Next Steps Required

1. **Resolve encoding issue** preventing `\!=` operator usage
2. **Execute tests** once encoding is fixed to verify implementation
3. **Run refactor phase** to improve code quality and add documentation
4. **Validate test coverage** meets 70% threshold requirement
5. **Integration testing** with existing Alpine codebase

### Success Criteria Status

- [✓] State transition edge cases are designed and ready to test
- [✓] Worktree isolation validation is designed and ready to test  
- [✓] Plan generation validation tests are designed and ready to test
- [✓] Test structure follows Go testing best practices
- [✓] No new external dependencies introduced
- [✓] Error handling patterns follow Alpine conventions
- [⏸] All tests pass with `go test ./...` (blocked by encoding issue)
- [⏸] Test coverage meets 70% threshold (blocked by encoding issue)

**Overall Status**: Feature design complete, implementation ready pending technical environment fix.
