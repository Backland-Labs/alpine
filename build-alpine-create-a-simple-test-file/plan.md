# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a simple test file that demonstrates proper Go testing patterns by testing a basic string utility function. This will be a focused example that shows table-driven testing with 2-3 test cases.

## Feature: Simple String Utility Function and Test

#### Task 1.1: Create a string utility function - DONE
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Function normalizes branch names by replacing invalid characters ✓
  * Function is exported and documented ✓
  * Function handles empty strings gracefully ✓
- Test Cases:
  * Test normalization of branch name with special characters ✓
- Integration Points:
  * None - standalone utility function ✓
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * internal/utils/string.go ✓

#### Task 1.2: Create test file with table-driven tests - DONE
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Test file follows Go naming convention (*_test.go) ✓
  * Uses table-driven test pattern ✓
  * Contains 3 test cases: normal input, empty string, special characters ✓
  * Test passes with `go test ./...` ✓
- Test Cases:
  * Verify all test cases execute and pass ✓
- Integration Points:
  * Integrates with existing Go test infrastructure ✓
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * internal/utils/string_test.go ✓

#### Task 1.3: Verify test integration - DONE
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Tests pass when running `go test ./internal/utils/...` ✓
  * No linting errors from `golangci-lint run` ✓
  * Test coverage reported correctly ✓
- Test Cases:
  * Run test suite and verify output ✓
- Integration Points:
  * Go testing toolchain ✓
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * None - verification only ✓

## Success Criteria
- [x] String utility function created with proper documentation
- [x] Test file created with table-driven test pattern
- [x] Tests include 3 cases: normal input, empty string, special characters
- [x] All tests pass with `go test ./...`
- [x] Code passes `golangci-lint run` checks
- [x] Test demonstrates proper Go testing conventions

## Implementation Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `NormalizeBranchName` function in `internal/utils/string.go`
- Function normalizes branch names by replacing invalid characters with hyphens
- Handles edge cases including empty strings and consecutive special characters
- Created comprehensive test suite in `internal/utils/string_test.go` using table-driven test pattern
- All tests pass with 100% code coverage
- Code passes all linting and formatting checks
- Follows TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**Files Created:**
- `/Users/max/code/alpine/build-alpine-create-a-simple-test-file/internal/utils/string.go`
- `/Users/max/code/alpine/build-alpine-create-a-simple-test-file/internal/utils/string_test.go`
