# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a simple test file that demonstrates proper Go testing patterns by testing a basic string utility function. This will be a focused example that shows table-driven testing with 2-3 test cases.

## Feature: Simple String Utility Function and Test

#### Task 1.1: Create a string utility function
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Function normalizes branch names by replacing invalid characters
  * Function is exported and documented
  * Function handles empty strings gracefully
- Test Cases:
  * Test normalization of branch name with special characters
- Integration Points:
  * None - standalone utility function
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * internal/utils/string.go

#### Task 1.2: Create test file with table-driven tests
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Test file follows Go naming convention (*_test.go)
  * Uses table-driven test pattern
  * Contains 3 test cases: normal input, empty string, special characters
  * Test passes with `go test ./...`
- Test Cases:
  * Verify all test cases execute and pass
- Integration Points:
  * Integrates with existing Go test infrastructure
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * internal/utils/string_test.go

#### Task 1.3: Verify test integration
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Tests pass when running `go test ./internal/utils/...`
  * No linting errors from `golangci-lint run`
  * Test coverage reported correctly
- Test Cases:
  * Run test suite and verify output
- Integration Points:
  * Go testing toolchain
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * None - verification only

## Success Criteria
- [ ] String utility function created with proper documentation
- [ ] Test file created with table-driven test pattern
- [ ] Tests include 3 cases: normal input, empty string, special characters
- [ ] All tests pass with `go test ./...`
- [ ] Code passes `golangci-lint run` checks
- [ ] Test demonstrates proper Go testing conventions
