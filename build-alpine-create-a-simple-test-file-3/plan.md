# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a simple test file that demonstrates basic Go testing patterns using only the standard library.

## Feature 1: Create Simple Test File
#### Task 1.1: Create a basic test file with simple test cases
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Create a test file named `simple_test.go` in the project root
  * Include 2-3 basic test cases using standard library only
  * Use table-driven test pattern
  * Test a trivial math function for demonstration
- Test Cases:
  * Test addition of two positive numbers
  * Test addition with zero
  * Test addition of negative numbers
- Integration Points:
  * None - standalone test file
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * simple_test.go

## Success Criteria
- [x] Simple test file created with basic math function
- [x] Test uses standard library testing package only
- [x] Test runs successfully with `go test`
- [x] Code follows Go formatting standards

## Implementation Status
- Status: **IMPLEMENTED** âœ… 
- Implementation Date: 2025-08-09
- Files Created: simple_test.go
- TDD Methodology: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle completed successfully

## Implementation Notes
- Created a simple test file with basic math function (Add)
- Used table-driven test pattern as requested
- Included 3 test cases: positive numbers, addition with zero, and negative numbers
- Function and tests use only Go standard library
- All tests pass and code follows Go formatting standards
