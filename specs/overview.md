# River Development Specifications Overview

This directory contains technical specifications for implementing the River automation system. Each spec focuses on a specific aspect of the development process.

## Core Development Areas

### [Type System](./types.md)
Defines the data structures and interfaces used throughout the codebase. Essential for understanding how information flows between Linear, Claude, and the automation system.

### [Error Handling](./error_handling.md)
Establishes patterns for graceful failure management and recovery strategies. Critical for building a resilient automation pipeline that can handle API failures and unexpected conditions.

### [Logging System](./logging.md)
Specifies structured logging requirements for debugging and monitoring the automation workflow. Provides visibility into the system's decision-making process.

### [Testing Strategy](./testing.md)
Outlines the Test-Driven Development approach and testing infrastructure. Ensures code quality and enables safe refactoring as the system evolves.

## Implementation Notes

- Start with the type system as it forms the foundation for all other components
- Error handling should be implemented early to avoid retrofitting
- Logging infrastructure should be integrated from the beginning
- Tests should be written alongside each feature following TDD principles

## Development Workflow

1. Review type definitions before implementing any feature
2. Set up error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
3. Instrument code with appropriate logging
4. Write tests first, then implementation
