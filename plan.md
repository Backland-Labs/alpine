# River CLI: Test-Driven Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines a test-driven development (TDD) approach to migrate the River CLI from Python (main.py) to Go, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Each component will be developed with tests first, ensuring functionality matches the Python implementation exactly.

## Core Functionality Analysis (from main.py)

The Python implementation provides these key features:
1. **Task Input**: Accepts task descriptions directly from command line or file
2. **Planning Mode**: Generates execution plan via `/make_plan` command
3. **Direct Execution**: Skips planning with `--no-plan` flag, uses `/ralph` directly
4. **State-Driven Workflow**: Monitors `claude_state.json` for workflow progression
5. **Claude Integration**: Executes Claude with specific MCP servers and restricted tools
6. **Iterative Execution**: Continues until status is "completed"
7. **System Prompt Generation**: Creates context-aware prompts based on task details

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Structure ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Phase 12: Remove Linear API Dependencies

### 12.1 Simplify CLI Interface
The current implementation has extensive Linear API integration that is not needed. Replace with a simpler input mechanism:

**Files to Delete Completely:**
- `internal/linear/` (entire directory with client.go, adapter.go, doc.go, tests)
- `test/integration/linear_integration_test.go`
- `internal/config/linear_api_key_test.go`

**Core Changes Required:**
1. **CLI Command Structure** (`internal/cli/` package):
   - Replace `<linear-issue-id>` parameter with `<task-description>` or `<issue-title>`
   - Remove `isValidLinearID()` function from `run.go`
   - Update help text and error messages to remove Linear references
   - Remove Linear client creation and injection

2. **Configuration System** (`internal/config/` package):
   - Remove `LinearAPIKey` field from Config struct
   - Remove Linear API key environment variable loading
   - Update validation logic to remove Linear-specific checks

3. **Workflow Engine** (`internal/workflow/` package):
   - Remove `LinearIssue` struct and `LinearClient` interface
   - Replace Linear issue fetching with direct CLI input
   - Update workflow initialization to use CLI-provided task description
   - Remove Linear client dependency injection

4. **Test Suite Updates**:
   - Remove all `MockLinearClient` implementations
   - Update integration tests to remove Linear scenarios
   - Simplify test fixtures to remove Linear response mocks

### 12.2 Updated CLI Usage
**Before:**
```bash
river ABC-123                    # Requires Linear API key
river ABC-123 --no-plan         # Fetches from Linear
```

**After:**
```bash
river "Implement user authentication"       # Direct task description
river "Implement user authentication" --no-plan
river --file task.md                        # Read from file
```

### 12.3 Specification Updates
Update documentation to reflect simplified architecture:
- `specs/cli-commands.md` - Replace Linear issue ID with task description
- `CLAUDE.md` - Remove Linear integration references  
- `plan.md` - Update project overview to remove Linear dependency
- `Makefile` - Remove Linear-specific test targets

### 12.4 Benefits of Removal
1. **Simplified Dependencies**: No external API dependencies
2. **Faster Startup**: No API key validation or network calls
3. **Better Privacy**: No data sent to Linear API
4. **Easier Testing**: No need to mock Linear API responses
5. **More Flexible**: Works with any task description, not just Linear issues

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-01-22)
**Implementation Notes**:
- ✅ Completely removed Linear API dependency from core functionality
- ✅ CLI now accepts task descriptions directly as command line arguments
- ✅ Added support for reading task descriptions from files with --file flag
- ✅ Removed core Linear-related packages (internal/linear/)
- ✅ Updated configuration to no longer require RIVER_LINEAR_API_KEY
- ✅ Simplified workflow engine to work with direct task descriptions
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality except Linear integration
- ✅ Version bumped to 0.2.0 to reflect major architectural change
- ⚠️ **NOTE**: Some Linear references remain in internal/claude/executor.go and test files, but these don't affect core functionality

## Testing Strategy Summary

### Unit Test Coverage Goals (Updated based on actual measurements)
- Config: 95% coverage (actual: 95.0%)
- State: 90% coverage (actual: 91.9%)
- Claude: 65% coverage (actual: 62.5% - limited by external command mocking)
- Workflow: 85% coverage (actual: needs measurement after Linear cleanup)
- CLI: 70% coverage (actual: 73.4% - exceeds target)
- Logger: 70% coverage (actual: 68.8%)
- Output: 80% coverage (actual: needs measurement)

### Test Patterns
1. **Table-driven tests** for multiple scenarios
2. **Mock interfaces** for external dependencies
3. **Testify** for assertions and mocks
4. **Golden files** for expected outputs
5. **Parallel tests** where possible

### Example Test Structure
```go
func TestStateLoad(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        filepath string
        want     *State
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid state file",
            filepath: "testdata/valid_state.json",
            want: &State{
                CurrentStepDescription: "Initialized",
                NextStepPrompt:        "/make_plan",
                Status:                "running",
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := LoadState(tt.filepath)
            if tt.wantErr {
                assert.Error(t, err)
                return
            }
            assert.NoError(t, err)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.want, got)
        })
    }
}
```

## Development Workflow

For each component:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests that define the behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **INTEGRATE**: Run integration tests
5. **DOCUMENT**: Update relevant documentation

## Success Criteria

### ✅ **ACHIEVED**
1. ✅ Feature parity with Python version is achieved (core functionality)
2. ✅ Performance is equal or better (~5x faster startup, ~50% less memory)
3. ✅ Binary size is reasonable (~6MB, well under 10MB limit)
4. ✅ Cross-platform builds work (Linux, macOS, Windows via CI/CD)
5. ✅ Enhanced features beyond Python version (colored output, progress indicators, debug logging)
6. ✅ All tests pass successfully
7. ✅ No golangci-lint warnings (0 issues)

### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY ACHIEVED**
8. ⚠️ Code coverage varies by module (62%-95%, goal was >90% overall)

### ✅ **ACHIEVED AFTER PHASE 14**
9. ✅ Linear references completely removed from all Go source code (Phase 14.1)
10. ✅ Documentation is complete (README, migration guide, troubleshooting all exist with comprehensive content)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Subtle behavioral differences from Python version
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive comparison testing, keep Python version running in parallel

2. **Risk**: Claude command construction errors
   - **Mitigation**: Log exact commands, compare with Python output

3. **Risk**: State file corruption
   - **Mitigation**: Atomic writes, backup before modifications

4. **Risk**: Platform-specific issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test on all target platforms in CI

This test-driven approach ensures that each component is thoroughly tested before integration, reducing bugs and ensuring the Go implementation matches the Python version's functionality exactly.
