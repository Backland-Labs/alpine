# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a simple test file for the validation package types to ensure basic struct instantiation and field assignment work correctly.

## Feature: Basic Types Test

#### Task 1.1: Create Simple Types Test
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-09)
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Test file validates that all types in types.go can be instantiated without panics
  * ✅ Basic field assignments work for each struct type
  * ✅ Test follows existing codebase conventions (uses testify assertions)
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ TestTypes_BasicInstantiation - Single test that creates instances of all types and assigns basic values
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Uses existing types from internal/validation/types.go
  * ✅ Uses testify/assert for consistency with other tests
- Files Created:
  * ✅ internal/validation/types_test.go

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Test file created at internal/validation/types_test.go
- ✅ All struct types can be instantiated without panics
- ✅ Basic field assignments work correctly
- ✅ Test passes with `go test ./internal/validation/...`

## Implementation Notes
- **Implementation Date**: January 9, 2025
- **TDD Methodology**: Followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **Testing Framework**: Used testify/assert for consistency with existing codebase
- **Code Quality**: Applied Go formatting and linting
- **Test Coverage**: All struct types from types.go covered:
  - ComparisonResult
  - Difference
  - CommandComponents
  - OutputMetrics
  - ParityConfig
  - ParityResults
  - ExecutionResult

## Technical Decisions
- Used testify assertions instead of plain error messages for better consistency with existing tests
- Focused on basic instantiation and field assignment rather than complex validation logic
- Maintained simple, readable test structure as requested in original task
- All types successfully instantiate and accept field assignments without panics
