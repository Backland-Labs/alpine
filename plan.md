# Implementation Plan: REST API Endpoints for Alpine

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of REST API endpoints that build on Alpine's existing HTTP server infrastructure. The goal is to enable programmatic workflow management while maintaining the current SSE functionality and following TDD principles.

### Objectives
- Add 10 REST API endpoints for agent and workflow management
- Integrate with existing workflow engine and state management
- Maintain backwards compatibility with current SSE implementation
- Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation updates

## Previous Implementation (Completed)

### Basic HTTP Server with SSE ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Added `--serve` and `--port` CLI flags ✅
- Created `internal/server` package with HTTP server ✅
- Implemented `/events` SSE endpoint ✅
- Integrated server into CLI workflow ✅
- Achieved 81.1% test coverage ✅

## Current Implementation: REST API Endpoints

### Task 1: Create REST API Data Models (TDD) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Define `Agent`, `Run`, and `Plan` structs in `internal/server/models.go` ✅
- Add comprehensive validation and JSON serialization ✅
- Create full test coverage in `internal/server/models_test.go` ✅
- Map data models to Alpine's existing workflow patterns ✅

**Key Data Structures:**
```go
type Agent struct {
    ID          string `json:"id"`
    Name        string `json:"name"`
    Description string `json:"description"`
}

type Run struct {
    ID        string    `json:"id"`
    AgentID   string    `json:"agent_id"`
    Status    string    `json:"status"` // running, completed, cancelled, failed
    Issue     string    `json:"issue"`
    Created   time.Time `json:"created"`
    Updated   time.Time `json:"updated"`
    WorktreeDir string  `json:"worktree_dir,omitempty"`
}

type Plan struct {
    RunID     string    `json:"run_id"`
    Content   string    `json:"content"`
    Status    string    `json:"status"` // pending, approved, rejected
    Created   time.Time `json:"created"`
    Updated   time.Time `json:"updated"`
}
```

**Test Cases:**
```go
// TestAgentValidation - Test agent struct validation and JSON marshaling
// TestRunLifecycle - Test run status transitions and validation
// TestPlanStatus - Test plan approval workflow
// TestModelSerialization - Test JSON serialization/deserialization
```

### Task 2: Implement REST API Handlers (TDD) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Add all 10 REST endpoints to `internal/server/server.go`
- Each endpoint has comprehensive unit tests
- Follow existing server patterns and error handling
- Integrate with Alpine's workflow engine

**Endpoints to Implement:**
1. `POST /agents/run` - Start workflow with GitHub issue
2. `GET /agents/list` - Return available agents (hardcoded MVP)
3. `GET /runs` - List all runs from in-memory store
4. `GET /runs/{id}` - Get specific run details
5. `GET /runs/{id}/events` - SSE endpoint for run-specific events
6. `POST /runs/{id}/cancel` - Cancel running workflow
7. `GET /plans/{runId}` - Get plan.md content
8. `POST /plans/{runId}/approve` - Approve plan and continue
9. `POST /plans/{runId}/feedback` - Send feedback on plan
10. `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

**Test Cases:**
```go
// TestHealthEndpoint - Simple health check
// TestAgentsRunEndpoint - Start workflow from GitHub issue
