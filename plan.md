# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create comprehensive documentation for all slash commands used in the Alpine system. This includes core workflow commands used by Alpine's state-driven architecture and custom Claude commands defined in the `.claude/commands/` directory.

## Documentation Task

#### Task 1: Create Slash Commands Documentation - COMPLETED
- Implementation Date: 2025-08-09
- Status: Completed
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Document all core workflow slash commands (`/make_plan`, `/start`, `/continue`, `/verify_plan`, `/run_implementation_loop`) ✓
  * Include custom Claude commands from `.claude/commands/` directory ✓
  * Follow existing specification documentation patterns ✓
  * Use clear descriptions, usage examples, and context for each command ✓
- Test Cases:
  * Verify documentation completeness by cross-referencing with codebase usage ✓
- Integration Points:
  * Reference from CLAUDE.md if helpful for users
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * Create: `/specs/slash-commands.md` ✓
  * Optionally update: `/CLAUDE.md` (add reference to new spec file)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Comprehensive slash commands documentation created in `specs/slash-commands.md`
- [x] All core workflow commands documented with clear descriptions and usage
- [x] Custom Claude commands documented with their purposes and configurations
- [x] Documentation follows existing spec file patterns and conventions
- [x] Optional reference added to CLAUDE.md for discoverability

## Implementation Notes
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/specs/slash-commands.md`
- Documented all 5 core workflow commands: `/make_plan`, `/start`, `/continue`, `/run_implementation_loop`, `/verify_plan`
- Documented custom `/docker_debug` command from `.claude/commands/`
- Included state management integration, workflow transitions, and technical implementation details
- Followed existing specification patterns for structure and formatting
- Provides clear usage examples and context for each command
