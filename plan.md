# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a test file named `test.txt` with the content "Testing hooks" to support testing of Alpine's Claude Code hooks integration functionality. The file will be placed in the appropriate test fixtures directory following the codebase's established patterns.

## Tasks

#### Task 1: Create test fixture file - âœ… COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * File `test.txt` exists in `test/integration/fixtures/` directory
  * File contains exactly the text "Testing hooks"
  * File follows Unix line endings (LF)
- Test Cases:
  * Verify file can be read by integration tests
- Integration Points:
  * May be used by hooks integration tests to verify file monitoring capabilities
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * Create: `test/integration/fixtures/test.txt`

#### Task 2: Verify worktree compatibility
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Test file is accessible when Alpine runs in worktree mode (default)
  * Test file is accessible when Alpine runs in bare mode (--no-worktree)
  * File operations on this test file are properly isolated in worktree mode
- Test Cases:
  * Manual verification that file is accessible in both execution modes
- Integration Points:
  * Alpine's worktree isolation system
  * Hooks system file monitoring
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * None (verification only)

## Success Criteria
- [x] File `test/integration/fixtures/test.txt` exists with content "Testing hooks"
- [x] File location follows codebase conventions (not in project root)
- [x] File is accessible in both worktree and bare execution modes
- [x] No modifications to existing code required
